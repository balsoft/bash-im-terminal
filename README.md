# Bash.im in your terminal

## Why?

Sometimes, you want to have a break, but don't want to switch between your terminal and browser.
That's why I've created this CLI tool, for fun.
You can navigate through random quotes from [bash.im](http://bash.im) right in your terminal.

## Pre-requisites

All what you need is NodeJS, preferable the latest version, since I'm using `async\await` here.

## Installing

```shell
sudo npm -g install bashim
```

## Have fun

```shell
bashim
```
